<span id="id1"></span><h1>A Description of a Complete Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#a-description-of-a-complete-dataset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The primary purpose of The Virtual Brain platform is to simulate whole brain
dynamics. A simulation pipeline has different stages. The most fundamental stage
is building a realization of a computational model which we call a large-scale
brain network model. This model is constituted by a set of structural and
functional components linked together, completely creating a particular model of
the brain.</p>
<p>The following document is a generic description of what we often call a &#8220;minimal
structural dataset for TVB&#8221; and &#8220;a complete dataset&#8221;. The aim of this document
is to specify the different pieces of data required to derive the structural
skeleton/substrate of a BNM. Hopefully, experts in the field of data acquisition
will help us completing and improving our description.</p>
<p>A complete dataset should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provide the history of the acquisition/processing protocols
(traceability);</li>
<li>be in a standard format to perform analysis with different
toolboxes;</li>
<li>have the <em>Minimal Structural Dataset</em> to derive a self-consistent
set of files used in TheVirtualBrain. This minla dataset will permit
users to build large-scale brain network models and save their
simulated data under different output modalities (eg, EEG, MEG,
fMRI).</li>
<li>increase reproducibility of the results.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="a-general-considerations">
<h2>A) GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS<a class="headerlink" href="#a-general-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A dataset should be made available on one single place (eg, through XNAT) to
ensure traceability and if required for clinical/privacy reasons, restricted
access.</p>
<p>NOTE: the following definitions are not definitive, if you come across with a better
categorization, please let us know.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Raw Structural Dataset</strong></dt>
<dd>a collection of files describing a subject&#8217;s head (eg, structural MRI AND DTI Data)</dd>
<dt><strong>Structural Dataset</strong></dt>
<dd>(a collection of T1/T2 weighted MRIscans + DTI data + parcellation )</dd>
<dt><strong>Minimal (Preprocessed) Structural Dataset</strong></dt>
<dd>(surface mesh, parcellation, region centres, region mapping, connectivity matrix)</dd>
<dt><strong>Complete Structural Dataset</strong></dt>
<dd>in addition to the structures mentioned above, head model surfaces and
information about the units (areas, lengths, connectivity strengths). Info
about the EEG/MEG/iEEG sensors if users wish to compare simulated data to
empirical data. <em>Complete Dataset</em>   all of the above + functional data (eeg,
rsfMRI, meg)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In general, all the steps in the processing pipeline should be documented, so
it&#8217;s possible to apply the same treatment to subsequent datasets.  Sending
pieces of informations in different files without descriptions from where they
came and how they were processed is a bad practice and only detrimental for your
own research project (takes a lot of time and it&#8217;s not reproducible). We can&#8217;t
provide any meaningful help to integrate/check or validate incomplete datasets.</p>
<p>Ideally, any volumetric data (eg, in NIFTI format), surface data (eg, GIFTI
format) or combination thereof (eg, CIFTI format) should be provided in their
RAW format, and if any pre-processing was performed on the raw data,  associated
data such as the region centres and parcellation mask should be provided in the
same coordinate system as the cortical mesh (ie, self-consistent dataset). The
meaning of the (x,y,z) coordinates depends entirely on how the volumetric file
was generated. It is possible to set any coordinate system you want (&#8220;native&#8221;,
&#8220;mni&#8221;, &#8220;talaraich&#8221;) depending on the processing you apply to your data.  A
region centre, for example, would be a single spatial location in 3D. This
location is specified by three numbers (x,y,z), these numbers should ideally
represent mm and must be relative to an origin (x=0, y=0, z=0). The &#8220;same
coordinate system&#8221; means that the origin is in the same location relative to the
head, and that the axis(x,y,z) point in the same direction with the same
orientation.</p>

<div class="section" id="b-parcellation-mask">
<h2>B) PARCELLATION MASK<a class="headerlink" href="#b-parcellation-mask" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>What is the purpose of the mask?</strong></dt>
<dd>A brain mask basically covers the standard brain. The mask needs to
partition/parcellate the volume of space containing the head/brain into regions.
It can be used to partition the cortical mesh into regions, consistently with
the derived parcellated connectivity matrices. So, for each row in a
connectivity matrix the mask needs to specify a region of space (region of
interest). The  mask can then be used to map the thousands of vertices which
make up the  surface mesh to the hundred or so regions in the connectivity
matrix,  that is, each region/row- in-a-connectivity-matrix is associated with
hundreds of vertices in the cortical mesh. So the mask provides a way for us to
generate a one to many mapping (region mapping) &#8211; from a row in the
connectivity matrix to the many vertices of the surface mesh which lie  in that
region. This anatomical parcellation is also used to obtain finer parcellations
and further divide the cortical surface into small regions of interest (REF to
Zalesky) and distinguish subcortical structures.</dd>
<dt><strong>What should be the format?</strong></dt>
<dd>NIFTI is a standard format for volumetric time-series, and it is widely used
in the neuroimaging commmunity. Originally, NIFTI-1 file format was based on
16-bit signed integers and was limited to 32,767 in each dimension. The
NIFTI-2 format is based on 64-bit integers and can handle very large volumes
and matrices. The more recent CIFTI format is compatible with the NIFTI-2
format and it also has the extension <em>.nii. We encourage to use the NIFTI-1
format (</em>.nii and <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3">*</span></a>.nii.gz).I</dd>
</dl>
<p>NOTE: add references to the libraries and softwares that are available for
NIFTI-1 TVB also has a reader. Not the same case for NIFTI-2 and CIFTI.
FieldTrip is the only one providing CIFTI i/o functionalities.</p>
<p>In the case of a parcellation mask, each voxel contains  an integer
corresponding to a specific region (numeric labeling). This means, assuming
voxels of 2x2x2 mm, the mask would consist of roughly 100x100x100 (ie, 1
million) voxels. The range of the integer number in each of these voxels should
correspond to the number of regions  (or rows ) in the parcellated connectivity
matrix.  Some voxels may contain no number or say -1, to specify that that piece
of space doesn&#8217;t belong to a region, for example if it lies outside of  the
head. These type of conventions should be specified and documented.
A list with the region names/labels and corresponding integer index should be provided.</p>
<p><strong>How should region labels and names look like provided with the mask?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>A region label is a short unique identifier, a region or area name usually
refers to a human readable description. Examples for one region/name would
be something like &#8216;label: RM-TCpol_R&#8217; / &#8216;name: right temporal polar cortex&#8217;.
Ideally, a reference to the original atlas/template should be provided as
well. Notice that the correspondance between integrers values in the
parcellation mask and anatomical/human readable labels should be provided if
they are not specified in the volume file.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Are region labels essential?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>From the point of view of the  implementation of The Virtual Brain the labels
are essential?</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Are region names essential?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>The region names on the other hand are  primarily a matter of usability,
though a very valuable one, when you want to identify an area that you wish to
modify in a  simulation (eg, modeling lesions). Unless a user is an anatomist
and acquainted with the labels, then the names are much clearer.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is information on cortical vs. subcortical regions needed?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>We need a means of distinguishing cortical from subcortical regions within
the mask, so that when we apply the mask to a cortical mesh we don&#8217;t
inadvertently associate parts of the cortex with subcortical regions in  the
connectivity matrix. Ultimately a vector of the length of the number  of
regions is needed, specifying whether each region is part of the  cortex or
not. If the labels or names clearly include this information,  that is they
clearly state whether they are cortical regions or not,  then the vector could
be generated on this basis.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Is the parcellation mask unique?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>No. Currently, there are several parcellation being used in the community.
NOTE: REF parcellation papers. One of the main problems is that parcellations
are often custom made and subsequently modified, so it becomes very difficult
to track the origins.  To begin with, we suggest to use parcellation mask
provided by neuroimaging software tools like FSL AAL 90. If you want to use a
custom made parcellation, then it should have the characteristics mentioned
above. Also, having the structural raw data it is possible to derive
connectivity matrices from the same dataset, but at different resolutions.
NOTE: (reference to Hagmann and Zalesky).</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the coordinate system of the parcellation mask?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>It depends on how the parcellation mask was obtained. In principle, it should
be registered to a standard space such as MNI. This coordinate systems should
be consitent with the surface&#8217;s coordinate systems.</div></blockquote>
</div>

<h2>C) CONNECTIVITY AND PATH LENGTH DATA<a class="headerlink" href="#c-connectivity-and-path-length-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is it required to build a connectivity matrix (parcellated connectome)?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>Diffusion data, a parcellation mask and probably the white matter surface (in
the same space, aligned). In TVB, we are not providing the tractography tools to
create structural connectivity matrices.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Are the tract lengths essential for using TVB?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>Yes. The simulations in TVB take into account time delays, and their magnitude is given</div></blockquote>
<p>by the distance between pairs of regions scaled by the conduction speed.</p>
<p><strong>Are the region centres important?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! If for a reason unbeknown to you, you happen to not have the white matter
fibre lengths, then TVB uses the region centres to compute a tract lengths
matrix based on the Euclidean distance between region pairs. The region centres
are merely a list of Cartesian triplets (x,y,z) that specify the spatial
location relative to the consistent coordinate system mentioned above. Each
region centre is just a single point in space, corresponding to the centre of
the region. The region itself might be spatially extended (if we have the
cortical surface), and thus not a single point.</p>
<p><strong>What is the parcellated connectome?</strong>
This term was introduced by the HCP, and it refers to the connectivity matrix.
For TVB a Connectivity refers to a set of two matrices (of size &#8220;anatomical
regions x anatomical regions &#8221;), one with weights giving the strength of     the
connections between anatomical regions and a second matrix with the     white
matter fibre lengths between regions;</p>

<div class="section" id="d-cortical-mesh">
<h2>D) CORTICAL MESH<a class="headerlink" href="#d-cortical-mesh" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We encourage to use the MNI brain template (eg, MNI152) to register your
subjects data and extract the corresponding cortical surface.</p>
<p><strong>Is the cortical surface essential?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Yes! Strictly speaking, TVB can perform simulations using only a parcellated
connectome as spatial support. From a scientific point of view MODELING THE
ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY ON THE FOLDED CORTICAL SURFACE is one of the most
interesting capabilities to exploit in TVB.  Modeling work where different
output modalities (like EEG and BOLD) are compared need a certain level of
geometrical detail that is not provided by a coarse-grained connectome. While
in the field of macroconnectomics, the parcellated connectome is sufficient
(debatable subject, see the paper by Zalesky), the cortical surface is
necessary to work with neural field modeling and to account for spatial
inhomogeneities.</p>
<p>The cortical surface, represents the outer surface of the gray matter. It&#8217;s
often called &#8216;pial surface&#8217;.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>How is a surface represented?</strong></p>
<p>A way of representing 2D meshes embedded in 3D space is by storing two arrays,
one for vertices, and one for triangles. Tha latter is an array with triplets
of indices into the first array of vertices. So, basically a surface mesh is
given by a set of vertices (triplets (x,y,z) defining the location of those
vertices). And alternatively, the mesh can be represented by triagle arrays
which are indices into the vertex arrays; three indices for each triangle.</p>
<p>Then there are other &#8216;attributes&#8217; that can be derived from these two main
arrays, for instance &#8216;normals&#8217;. A normal determine&#8217;s the orientation of a vertex.</p>
<p>All vertex-related/derived information is calculated and stored in separate
arrays, althoug bound to the surface instance they were derived from. Read
more about normals here: <a class="reference external" href="http://user.xmission.com/~nate/smooth.html">http://user.xmission.com/~nate/smooth.html</a></p>

<h2>E) REGION MAPPING<a class="headerlink" href="#e-region-mapping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is the Region Mapping?</strong></p>
<p>The region mapping is just a relationship between the two pieces of data,
mapping regions of a connectivity onto the nodes of a surface simulation, one
to  many for the vertices of the cortical surface and one to one for the
remaining  noncortical regions.  NOTE: A region mapping could be between two
connectomes of different resolution (eg, the connectomes presented in Hagmann
998 to 66 regions).</p>
<p><strong>How is the Region Mapping obtained?</strong>
Good question!</p>
<p>TODO: Add links to relevant documentation.</p>

<div class="section" id="f-head-model">
<h2>F) HEAD MODEL<a class="headerlink" href="#f-head-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of the head model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Head</strong>: the bucket that contains the brain. The head is often represented as
a set of concentric spheres, in order to compute the electric field or
potential on the skin surface (eg, as recorded with EEG electrodes). The
concentric spheres (surfaces) represent the boundaries between the brain and
the skull; the skull and the skin; and, the skin and the air. Mesh</p>
<p><strong>What should be the format?</strong>
A surface format like GIFTI, or in the same format used for the cortical mesh.</p>
<p><strong>Is the head model essential?</strong></p>
<p>From a scientific point of view, it is essential to compute the lead-field
matrices which will  project the neural activity time-series into sensor space
(eg, EEG).  The boundary surfaces are then required to assist Open MEEG (or
any other similar tool like FieldTrip) to generate good forward models for
EEG/MEG)</p>

<p>## The TVB demonstration dataset</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This dataset was custom made and built to serve the purpose of
numerically testing the simulator, as well as for theoretical exploration. It
does have, however, certain issues with regard to biophysical realism and so
shouldn&#8217;t be used/relied-upon for that purpose. References, where appropiate,
are given. Also, this is an open source project and contributions are greatly
appreciated. If you see an error, please leave a comment or make corresponding
modifications [please give proper references and argument your corrections].</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The parcellation was chosen to be as homologous as possible between Macaque
and Human. (See the [scalable brain atlas interactive tool](<a class="reference external" href="http://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/main/coronal3d.php?template=PHT00&amp;plugin=CoCoMac">http://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/main/coronal3d.php?template=PHT00&amp;plugin=CoCoMac</a>))</li>
<li>Weights are primarily CoCoMac &#8211; exceptions are colossal connections. These
are DSI fibre bundle widths scaled to fill the 0-3 of CoCoMac.</li>
<li>Most colossal connection are missing. Tract-lengths are actual DSI tracts
where possible and Euclidean distance used where explicit DSI/DTI tract-
lengths weren&#8217;t available.</li>
<li>Region centres were generated to be consistent with the demo cortical
surface.</li>
<li>In the current parcellated connectome all the non-cortical regions were
stripped.</li>
<li>The CoCoMac connectivity belongs to a single hemisphere, so the
weights matrix is symmetric (weighted undirected graph), but the DSI was
&#8220;whole&#8221; brain and so there is probably hemispheric asymmetry in tract lengths
and the cortical surface is hemispherically asymmetric so region centres aren&#8217;t
the same for both hemispheres. (this item is maybe deprecated...)</li>
</ul>
<p>The default TVB connectivity is a bi-hemispheric hybrid CoCoMac/DSI matrix.
Subcortical regions (e.g. thalamus and other subcortical nuclei) are not
included in this matrix.</p>

<h3>The Human Connectome Project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-human-connectome-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So far, the most complete datasets available.  We aim to integrate some of the
datasets provided by the HCP. Structural connectivity is the fundamental
substrate for building large-scale brain network models, and being able to use
these high quality, standardized and equally pre-processed data would be
ideal.</p>
<p>However, &#8220;advanced&#8221; HCP datasets will be hopefully released next year.  The HCP
data release does not include extensively processed connectivity data for
individual subjects, but mainly &#8220;an average dataset&#8221;. In the current release, Q3,
there are dense (&#8220;grayordinate-to-grayordinate&#8221;) functional connectivity
datasets based on resting state fMRI from individual subjects. However, HCP
people are still working on improving many of the steps for generating
structural connectivity datasets, based on diffusion imaging and probabilistic
tractography. In the future, they will release probabilistic tractography and
&#8220;dense structural connectome&#8221; datasets ( perhaps with the Q4 release, Q3 release
was made available on September 20th, 2013)</p>
<p>There are ongoing efforts both within and outside the HCP consortium to
generate improved methods of brain parcellation, especially cerebral cortex.
&#8220;HCP- sanctioned&#8221; parcellated connectome datasets (based on improved cortical
parcellations) will be made publicly available in the future (no target date
announced yet). Once these (plus the dense connectome datasets) are released,
users will be able to generate parcellated connectomes based on their own
preferred parcellation scheme.</p>
<p>They do plan to make a (FieldTrip-compatible) head model available for each
subject scanned using MEG.</p>
<p>What they have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Almost everything: raw, minimally processed and processed data.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s missing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Preprocessed diffusion data (eg, fiber orientation, fiber tracts) and derived</li>
</ul>
<p>structural connectomes and individual based parcellations.</p>
<p>Permissions:
* available after agreeing with the privacy and sharing conditions. In principle,
datasets can be distributed as long as we make users sign the terms required by
the HCP. I would suggest, once the dense and some parcellated connectomes are
available, to buy the connectome in a box and have a copy in a centralized
storage server so TVB can read these data in.</p>
